Foundation5-Slick-Slider
========================

This is a Working code of Foundation 5 using Marketing Theme with Slick Slider, since Orbit is deprecated. 

Source codes from: https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/
and: https://github.com/zurb/foundation

The original Slider in Foundation 5 project was Orbit, but now it's deprecated, the following is taken from the original site:
DEPRECATION NOTICE:
Orbit has been deprecated, meaning that it is no longer supported. There's no need to worry though as we decided to leave it in Foundation if you choose to continue using it. We explain it here.
There are other great options if you need an image slider. A lot of them have features based on Orbit and may have added one of two more features.
This image slider is really slick: Slick Carousel. It has all the features Orbit has and can also be used as a carousel for single image sliding. It's easy to set up and is well supported.
Orbit is also not accessible to screen readers or assistive devices.

So, I decided to make it work and well, here it is!

Any doubt just send me a message!
Enjoy!
